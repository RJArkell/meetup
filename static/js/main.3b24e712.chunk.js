This month we\u2019re going to dive into how we\u2019re Managing Complexity in our Automation team.</p> <p>David Cameron will talk about the problems we are solving in our Automation team, and the challenges that come with building products that are platforms rather than solutions to specific problems.</p> <p>Mitch Dickinson will talk about how complexity can be managed by allowing third parties to inject custom code into a system. By allowing merchants and partners to provide their own code for a complex process, we can avoid having to build that complexity into our core for all merchants. We will go deep, exploring how Shopify is trying to solve this using a serverless WebAssembly runtime to host untrusted code.</p> <p>Jos\xe9 Torre will talk about how to make complexity accessible. Reflecting on the process of redesigning an app that is meant to bring the power of automation to the hands of merchants. Sharing lessons learned and what he would have done differently if he started tackling the problem now.</p> <p>As always, we'll have food and drinks to enjoy throughout the evening.</p> <p>## What to expect:</p> <p>The talks cover the complexity of building automations and customizations from 3 very different perspectives \u2014 product, engineering and design. No matter your background, you\u2019ll walk away learning something new.</p> <p>## Who are the speakers?</p> <p>David Cameron (<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjcameron/ class=linkifie>https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjcameron/</a>) is a Product Lead at Shopify.

While we know itâ€™s impossible to write perfect code, we want to craft code that we arenâ€™t embarrassed to put our names on for the documentation. Good Software Engineers write code that separates concerns, avoids tight coupling and interdependency between classes or methods, all while being easy to use and maintain. There are a number of different methods and patterns that help us achieve this, but one of the ways is through Inversion of Control (IoC) - the daughter pattern of dependency injection. Want to know how to do it with JavaScript/TypeScript? Want to know how to test it? See you on February 19th!</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6pm: Doors Open<br/>6:30pm - 7:30pm: Tech Talk<br/>7:30pm - 8:15pm: Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>Gareth Sharpe is a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Manulife working on the Salesforce platform team developing GraphQL microservices for API consumers external to Salesforce.

      description: '<p>Shopify removes unnecessary complexity from merchants\' lives, but sometimes thatâ€™s the nature of their business and complexity is essential. This month weâ€™re going to dive into how weâ€™re Managing Complexity in our Automation team.</p> <p>David Cameron will talk about the problems we are solving in our Automation team, and the challenges that come with building products that are platforms rather than solutions to specific problems.</p> <p>Mitch Dickinson will talk about how complexity can be managed by allowing third parties to inject custom code into a system. By allowing merchants and partners to provide their own code for a complex process, we can avoid having to build that complexity into our core for all merchants. We will go deep, exploring how Shopify is trying to solve this using a serverless WebAssembly runtime to host untrusted code.</p> <p>JosÃ© Torre will talk about how to make complexity accessible. Reflecting on the process of redesigning an app that is meant to bring the power of automation to the hands of merchants. Sharing lessons learned and what he would have done differently if he started tackling the problem now.</p> <p>As always, we\'ll have food and drinks to enjoy throughout the evening.</p> <p>## What to expect:</p> <p>The talks cover the complexity of building automations and customizations from 3 very different perspectives â€” product, engineering and design. No matter your background, youâ€™ll walk away learning something new.</p> <p>## Who are the speakers?</p> <p>David Cameron (<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjcameron/ class=linkifie>https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjcameron/</a>) is a Product Lead at Shopify. He leads the product direction for our Automation products Shopify Flow, Shopify Scripts, and Launchpad. He also enjoys automating his home and finding delightful solutions to problems.</p> <p>Mitch Dickinson (<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchdickinson/ class=linkified>https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchdickinson/</a>) is a Development Manager at Shopify. He has been leading the efforts to rebuild Shopify Scripts (<a href=https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/apps-by-shopify/script-editor class=linkified>https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/apps-by-shopify/script-editor</a>), to make a more extensible commerce platform for all merchants. He loves elegant software design, DDD, and databases. He joined Shopify 16 months ago and has a background of working for startups in the Waterloo region.</p> <p>JosÃ© Torre (<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-torre-3979b821/class=linkified>https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-torre-3979b821/</a>) is a staff product designer at Shopify, where he has been working for almost 6 months. He joined the Automation team with the task of redesigning Flow, a workflow automation app. In his spare time he writes n Medium about design (<a href=https://medium.com/@zecarlostorre class=linkified>https://medium.com/@zecarlostorre</a>).</p> <p>## Is this event for you?</p> <p>This event is intended for anyone with an interest in building software products, whether it be technical, design, or product. The talks are all approachable regardless of your background!</p> <p>Our office is fully accessible and we have gender neutral facilities available on site.
